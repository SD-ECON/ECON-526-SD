1,Postcensal estimates are based on the 2021 Census counts adjusted for census net undercoverage (CNU) (including adjustment for incompletely enumerated reserves and settlements (IERS)) and the components of demographic growth that occurred since that census. Intercensal estimates are produced using counts from two consecutive censuses adjusted for CNU (including IERS) and postcensal estimates.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Population estimates: Q1 = January 1; Q2 = April 1; Q3 = July 1; Q4 = October 1.,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"Estimates are final intercensal and unadjusted for census net undercoverage prior to July 1, 1971. Estimates are final intercensal from July 1, 1971 to April 1, 2021, final postcensal for July 1, 2021, updated postcensal from October 1, 2021 to April 1, 2023 and preliminary postcensal from July 1, 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of the natural growth (Table 17100059), international migration (Table 17100040) and interprovincial migration (Tables 17100020 and 17100045).",,,,,,,,,,,,
